Cypress</div><div id="blip-description-1" class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Cypress is a test automation tool for&nbsp;writing reliable and scalable E2E tests on modern web applications. It focuses on usability for both developers and test automation engineers, breaking the silos between QA and DEV.
Cypress is in the “Market Mature” ring because it has already proven itself in the test community. Many full-stack web frameworks include it as the default E2E test framework. Since writing tests in JavaScript and TypeScript is so easy, it is highly adoptable by developers. It has some amazing features, including comprehensive documentation, automatically load balanced parallelisation of tests, and the Cypress dashboard for test analytics.&nbsp; It is in active development, with a new version being release several times each month.

Feedback from production</div><div id="blip-description-4" class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Getting Feedback from production is also known as ‘Shifting-Right’. In an effor to be more agile, many organisations have invested in the well-known process of ‘Shifting-Left’. This means testing and getting feedback in your development lifecycle as early as possible. The lesser-known, and now emerging, concept of ‘Shifting-Right’ focuses on leveraging your production systems as part of a feedback loop to increase confidence and decrease your testing efforts up-front, especially when Continuous Delivery is being practised. Both Technical Monitoring and Functional Monitoring add feedback to catch issues that impact your customer experience. We believe Functional Monitoring is key to getting the right feedback from production to ensure that customer-impacting issues can be quickly found and fixed. Check out <a href="https://qxperts.io/improve-your-functional-monitoring-with-the-functional-monitoring-quadrants/">our blog</a> for more information to get started.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item" id="blip-list-item-5">5. Change management</div><div id="blip-description-5" class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Change management is about implementing strategies for dealing with necessary changes in an organisation's goals, processes or technologies, and to help people adapt to these changes.
<br>Change management is positioned in the "Growing market" ring as coping with change has become more challenging in agile environments and, while the concepts are old, change management is currently reinventing itself to adapt to the new ways of working.</p><p></p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item" id="blip-list-item-6">6. Deployment automation</div><div id="blip-description-6" class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Deployment Automation allows for the rapid release of products and features to various environments, freeing developers from the pain and mistakes normally associated with manual deployments. As a key element in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines, it is more a practise than a technology and vital for any organization wanting to increase their velocity.
<br>Deployment Automation is in the "Market mature" ring because it has been an established practise for many decades, at least as long as CI/CD.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item" id="blip-list-item-7">7. Infrastructure as code</div><div id="blip-description-7" class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Infrastructure as Code is a technique to help manage IT infrastructure by using code (machine and human readable definitions) instead of manually mutating configurations of infrastructure, teams use software development principles like code repositories, collaboration tooling (MR reviews), testing and delivering techniques of IT landscape configuration changes. 
<br>IaC is in the "Market mature" ring because it has been an established practise, with many tools now available and major cloud / infrastructure providers already using this principle.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item" id="blip-list-item-8">8. Continous Delivery</div><div id="blip-description-8" class="blip-item-description"><p><p>As an industry, we are gradually learning that adding more steps and controls between development and deployment does not make for a safer release. The data suggests the opposite: organisations that release often, have the safest releases. Releasing often means that we release smaller increments and have a greater rate of learning. The best performers release multiple times a day, and they are leaving the competition behind. 
<br>To realise this fast cadence we need to continuously integrate with our team members to get our code into an always-deployable state. This continuously integrated codebase needs to be deployed continuously to our environments. Doing multiple deployments per day means we need to automate everything. The practice of continuously deploying is getting market mature (as the data suggests) and the tooling is following close behind. With Infrastructure as Code, GitOps and Observability tooling becoming mainstream, the goal of continuous Delivery is getting in range of almost all software organisations.</p></p></div></li></ul><h3>Exploring</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item" id="blip-list-item-10">10. Proactive notifications</div><div id="blip-description-10" class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Proactive notifications means informing interested parties of potential issues using trained AI models to identify certain anomalous behaviour. Doing this ensures they do not accure and can be solved proactively and prevent a possible negative outcome (like a noticeable outage / issue with business impact) . It is used mainly in monitoring products which have all the necessary infrastructure / application contexts to make predictions.

<br>Proactive notifications is positioned in the "Exploring market" ring as it's actively being worked on and many new technologies frequently become available.</p></p></div></li></ul><h3>Growing</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item" id="blip-list-item-9">9. Disaster recovery testing</div><div id="blip-description-9" class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Disaster recovery testing is about testing the (often theoretical) plans to recover from a critical event that cripples the operational ability of an organization.

<br>Disaster recovery testing is positioned in the "Growing Market" ring as, with the rise of Cloud and DevOps, more possibilities are becoming available to do Disaster Recovery Testing on a continuous basis and to make it part of the normal Quality Assurance activities during the Software Development Lifecycle.</p></p></div></li></ul></div><div class="quadrant-table third"><h2 class="quadrant-table__name">Delivery</h2><h3>Mature</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item" id="blip-list-item-11">11.
